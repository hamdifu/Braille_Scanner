# Braille Convertor

Braille Convertor is a efficient text to Braille translator. This is an android mobile application which is aimed at providing braille translation for potential learners who partially impaired as well as anyone who is interested in learning braille script.

# Description

This project is built on android studio using Java as the primary language. It further uses Machine learning based models for image translation and API intergrations for incorporating both the fuctionalities.

__Working :__

__1.__ Any image containing text can be uploaded to the application for translation.

__2.__ We have built a machine learning model which uses pattern recognition technology implemented using CNN and is trained on 1395 samples.

__3.__ The model is converted to  an API, and tie image taken as input is passed to the API which returns the translation results to our application.

__Challenges :__

We initially tried to implement braille to text converter but the model accuracy and training data was the constant challenge as images clicked from mobile cameras are not very refined, so pattern recognitionbecome an issue.

## Tech Stack

__1.__ Machine Learning using Python

__2.__ Android Studio

__3.__ Android Programming

__4.__ Java Programming

__5.__ REST API using Flask
